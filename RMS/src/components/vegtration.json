        "description":"Eating whole grain and ancient grains is helping me keep fit and healthy. There was a time when I kept away from the grains not knowing it\u2019s benefits. But once I learnt about the benefits of whole grains I started including it in my diet. Initially, I have been experimenting with the grain by making dishes out of it and ate it all by my own. Now, I started giving it to my family and kids too. Buckwheat is actually not a grain; it\u2019s a grain like fruit seeds, a super food. Buckwheat may be one of the super foods you are not eating. Not only is it healthy, but tasty too. And it\u2019s a great substitution for rice! Make every day khichdi, pulav or even other variety rice dishes with buckwheat. This vegetable khichdi using buckwheat is the simplest dish just like any other khichdi and the taste is amazing too.",

Keep repeating (adding more water) until the water is almost clear.Add slit green chillies to the mangoes in the saucepan. Heat on medium heat and bring to a boil.Once it comes to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes until the mangoes are cooked well and become soft; about 15 to 20 minutes.Add jaggery to taste along with some salt; adjust to suit your taste; mix well.Simmer for about 5 minutes or more until you get a good consistency.We love our mango curry a bit diluted; but if you want a thicker gravy, you can add a slurry of rice flour in water (about 2 to 3 teaspoons of rice flour in \u00bc cup of water) to the boiling curry and boil until thick.Now, it is time to season or temper the curry.In a small saucepan, heat ghee. Once the ghee is hot, add mustard seeds and when they start to splutter and crackle, add the dry red chillies and hing.Immediately add to the curry and give it a good stir.Sweet, tangy and exotic Konkani style mango curry is ready.Mangalorean Style Ambe Upkari Recipe is usually served as a side dish with a South Indian Meal of Steamed rice,\u00a0Mangalorean Style Sajjige Rotti, steamed rice,\u00a0Sprouted Moong Dal Curry\u00a0and\u00a0Mangalorean Style Sonay Sukka Recipe (Dry Chickpea Stir Fry Recipe).",

After the first whistle, turn the heat to low and simmer the dal for about 3 to 4 minutes. After 3 to 4 minutes, turn off the heat.

Roll the portions of phulka (roti) dough into balls; flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.Take a portion of the phulka dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.Cook the rolled dough as indicated in the steps below. Continue the process of rolling with the remaining portions of the dough.Tip: It is a good idea to roll out a batch of dough so it gets easier to cook the entire batch.
