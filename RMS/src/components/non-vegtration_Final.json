Today I am sharing a croquette recipe that used minced meat as the main ingredient instead of potato and whole boiled eggs used for stuffing. Its one of those delicious appetisers that you would be happy to serve to your guests. It\u2019s so good and easy to make. Since I used minced mutton I cooked the meat first with spices and then shaped it into cylindrical with boiled eggs as stuffing, rolled in floor, eggs wash and bread crumbs then deep fried it.",

I cooked the meat in its own juices without adding any water.Took about 30 minutes to get it fully cooked. Remove from stove and cool completely.Heat oil for deep frying in a deep fry pan. Divide the minced mutton mixture into 4 equal portions.Take one portion and place it in your palm, press and try to get it together.Slightly flatten it and place one full boiled egg in the middle and gather the meat to cover the egg fully. Try to shape it into cylindrical shape.If you find it too hard to handle the meat to shape it, try adding 1 or 2 teaspoon of beaten egg and work with the meat.Roll the croquettes in flour first, then dip it in egg and then roll with bread crumbs.Repeat this for all the meat.

Keep it aside.Take a bowl and add curd, half of the green paste that we made above and half of the turmeric powder. Mix it well.\u00a0Next add the chicken pieces into the bowl and coat the chicken with this coriander, ginger and garlic mixture. Once it is done, keep the chicken aside to marinate for about an hour.\u00a0The next step is to make the gravy for the methi chicken curry.Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan over medium heat.Once the oil is hot, add the sliced onions and saute adding a pinch salt to speed up the caramelization (browning). Keep stirring on low to medium heat constantly till the onions are lightly browned.The caramelised onions impart a delicious flavour to the Methi Chicken Curry.Turn off the heat and keep these onions aside to cool down a bit. When cooled down, grind to a fine paste in a mixer grinder.Heat oil into the same pan over medium heat. Add the whole spices mentioned for tempering which includes cloves, cinnamon stick, cardamom, black peppercorn and bay leaves. Saute until the aromas of the spices wafts in the air.\u00a0Next add the remaining green coriander paste, the caramelized\u00a0onion paste and stir for a couple of minutes.

Saute and cover the pan with a lid and cook until the tomatoes turn soft.Once the tomatoes are soft, add the red chilli powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder and mix well. Add the chopped methi leaves and saute till the leaves become soft.At this stage, add the marinated chicken with the entire marinade and saute on high flame for 2 to 3 minutes.When the chicken changes colour, add a cup of water and bring the mixture to a boil. Add salt to taste. Cover and cook the Methi Chicken Curry on medium heat stirring occasionally. It will take about 20 minutes to cook the chicken to perfection.When the chicken is fully cooked, add the kasuri methi and check seasoning. Adjust salt and other spices if desired.

Customers are free to pick and choose from the display, that later gets served at their dinner table. One such dish which I always relish at my favourite restaurant in Goa is the Prawn Balchao. My colleagues love the prawn masala used in this one as the dish is a mixture of sweet, spice and sourness. The unique ingredient that makes the prawn even more delectable is the Goan Toddy Vinegar - one can get this in the Saturday Mapusa Market.",

        "instructions":"To begin making the Goan Style Empada De Camarao Recipe, we will make the pie crust first. Get all the ingredients ready and get your butter cut into small pea size pieces.The next step is to make the dough for the pie crust. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Add the butter into the flour mixture.Work the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. When you hold the flour together, it should hold tight and when you let it loose, it will fall apart.Sprinkle ice water onto the flour and butter mixture.\u00a0 Using your hands push the dough from the sides to the middle of the bowl to form a ball that holds together.Make sure to add little water at a time, as the heat from your hands will melt the butter and help form the dough as well.You can transfer the pie dough on to a work surface and knead the dough until all the flour has come together to form a smooth dough.Once done, wrap the dough in a cling film or a plastic wrap and refrigerate it for a couple of hours. This refrigeration process helps to give the pie crust a flaky texture.To make the filling, grind the ingredients for Recheado masala in a mixer grinder to a smooth paste and keep it aside.Heat a kadai with oil, add chopped onions and saute till they turn translucent. Add in tomatoes and saute till it becomes mushy and soft.Add your ground recheado masala and keep saut\u00e9ing until the raw smell from the masala goes away. Add chopped prawns at the end, sprinkle with little salt and cook until the prawns curl up and switch off the flame immediately. \u00a0Set aside the filling to cool, pre heat the oven to 180 degree Celsius to 10 minutes and leave it aside. Remove the dough from the refrigerator to start rolling.On a generously floured surface, Divide the dough into two equal parts, gently flatten the ball of the dough with a rolling pin. Starting from the center, roll the dough into a circle about an inch larger than the diameter of the pan that you plan to use.Once rolled out lift the dough into the pan. Fold the edges under and crimp with your fingers or a fork.Blind bake the pie crust in the oven for about 5 minutes and take it out. Add the filling inside and flatten it.Roll out the other half of the pie crust pastry as flat and big as possible, in order to cover the tart on top. Carefully lift the dough and place it on top of the pie and cut of the extras from the ends. By using a forst poke holes on top.Bake it in the oven at 180 degree Celsius for over 30 minutes till you get a nice crispy crust on top. You can also egg brush to get a nice color.Serve the Goan Style Empada De Camarao Recipe along with a\u00a0salad\u00a0and a\u00a0Orange Mocktail Recipe\u00a0to make it a complete meal.",
